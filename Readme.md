WildflowerForecastr
===================

This Flask project will generate wildflower bloom predictions for Southern Arizona.

Python is the programming language, and it will use considerable computing
power to execute the bioinformatics algorithms.

I may expand to other locales, such as Southern California, Utah, New Mexico, 
Texas; in general, the American Southwest.
